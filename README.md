# 👋 Hi, I'm Emna Adhar

I'm a freshly graduated engineer in **Robotics, Control Theory, and Machine Learning**, currently pursuing opportunities for a **PhD in soft robotics, embodied intelligence, and/or any unconventional approach to robotics**.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Soft and continuum robotics  
- Embodied intelligence & bio-inspired mechanisms  
- Learning-based control (RL, imitation learning)  
- Safe and sample-efficient exploration  
- Unconventional sensing and actuation  
- Micro-robots and medical robotics  

## 🎯 What I'm Currently Working On
- Designing and simulating bio-inspired soft robotic systems  
- Exploring control strategies for tendon-driven and deformable robots  
- Studying *The Science of Soft Robotics: Design, Materials and Information Processing* (Springer)  
- Conducting a literature review on RL/IL methods for contact-rich, morphology-dependent control  
- Building a weekly series of **scientific chronicles** on robotics and AI  

## 🔍 Looking For
Opportunities to collaborate on:
- Soft robotics  
- Robot learning  
- Safe control for complex systems  
- Research-oriented robotics projects  

If you’re working on related topics and think I could contribute, feel free to reach out.
